# README

Script processing of the raw UCI Human Activity Recognition Dataset collected from Samsung Galaxy S smartphones.

The repo contains a run_analysis.R script that will read the UCI HAR Dataset combining the training and test sets and outputting a tidy data set that contains the averages of all the mean/std measurements for each activity per subject. 

The tidy data set is contained in tidy_data.txt.

The CookBook.md contains the descriptions of the variables and an overview of the data transformations performed by the script.
