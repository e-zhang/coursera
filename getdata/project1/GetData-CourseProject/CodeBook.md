# Summary Choices

The dataset includes the average of each variable's measurement for a subject during a particular activity on a row. 

There were 6 different activities and 30 different subjects for a total of 180 rows. 

# Transformations

The data is read in via X_train.txt and X_test.txt.

The features are read in via features.txt.

The activity descriptions are read in via activity_labels.txt.

The activity descriptions are transformed by mapping the integer value from Y_train.txt and Y_test.txt to the corresponding description in activity_labels.txt.

The subject ids are read in via subject_train.txt and subject_test.txt.

The separate train and test datasets are merged into one.

The mean and std measurements are selected from the merged dataset and grouped by subject and activity. The mean is then extracted for each subject and activity combination.
